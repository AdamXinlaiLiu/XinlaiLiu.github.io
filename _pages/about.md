I am an **Ezra Systems Postdoctoral Associate** and **Visiting Lecturer** working with [Prof. H. Oliver Gao](https://www.duffield.cornell.edu/people/h-oliver-gao/) in the **Systems Engineering** program at **Cornell University**, Ithaca, NY. I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof. George Q. Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/george-huang/?sc_lang=en).

My research lies at the intersection of **blockchain and AI systems**, and **data-driven decision-making**, with a focus on trustworthy and efficient solutions for sustainability, climate action, and industrial operations. A central theme of my work is using blockchain and trustworthy AI to bring trust into multil-stakeholder collaboration and to turn complex product lifecycle data into useful insights that support societal and operational decision-making. I develop blockchain-based and AI-powered systems for carbon registries and markets, corporate ESG assessment, production and supply chains. More broadly, I aim to design trustworthy systems and models in the AI era to bridge methodological rigor with real-world impact across manufacturing, energy, and immersive technologies.

**Key areas of my research interests include:**

- **Trustworthy AI and agentic systems** – AI-powered sustainability reporting and auditing, multi-agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-involved trustworthy AI analytics.
- **Blockchain for climate and sustainability** – blockchain-based systems for credible climate action in carbon registries, and mechanism design in carbon markets.
- **Corporate sustainability and ESG** – blockchain-enabled environmental, social, and governance (ESG) platforms, data-driven ESG assessment, and token-based incentive mechanism for corporate sustainability disclosure.
- **Production and supply chain** – Cloud computing and optimization analytics using complex and large-scale data in production and supply chain.

I am always open to collaborative opportunities in these areas and welcome interdisciplinary projects with societal impact. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:xl957@cornell.edu) if you are interested in working together.

*Outside of work, I enjoy reading, playing basketball, watching NBA; I am always happy to connect to explore new ideas for the betterment of the society and next generations.*
