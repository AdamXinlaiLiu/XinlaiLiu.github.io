Course instructor for **Industrial Blockchain Systems and Applications** at Cornell University, with **Boeing Gift Funding** supporting student-led, project-based innovation in Cornell Systems Engineering.

The course explores blockchain from three angles:
- **Theory:** Why blockchain is immutable—how cryptography and consensus create trust
- **Platforms:** How Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric work in practice
- **Applications:** Integrating blockchain with existing technologies and real industrial applications (e.g., supply chain, sustainability)

This year’s course theme: **"Blockchain: A Trustworthy Friend in the Era of AI."**

Taught to 11 students from various backgrounds (Computer Science, Systems Engineering, Environmental Engineering, etc.) in both on-campus and distance learning modes.
