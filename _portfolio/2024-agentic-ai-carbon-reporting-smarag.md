**Role:** Project Manager  
**Institution:** Cornell Systems Engineering  
**Period:** One year  
**System:** [SMARAG — Agentic AI for Carbon Reporting](https://smarag.cee.cornell.edu/)

To build secure, efficient, and accurate carbon reporting, I led five postgraduate students through AI system architecture, design, development, deployment, and evaluation. The deployed Agentic AI system (SMARAG) shortens traditional carbon report generation from several months to merely minutes. It is applied by the Cornell Sustainability Office.

One relevant research paper is under review by *Expert Systems with Applications*; another is in progress targeting *IISE Transactions*.
